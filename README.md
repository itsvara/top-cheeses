# top-cheeses

## WARNING: this was made for funnies and is pretty buggy
## ALSO: you will need a webdriver to actually scrape the images, this uses chromes webdriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) but you could probably modify this to make it work with firefox etc 

### using old meme as an excuse to learn web scraping 

#### plan
##### figure out how to scrape images of cheese and let user choose how many cheese pictures they want (watch and use: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBuED2PivbY ) ✔

##### automatically create first screen at start of video saying \[top \[NUMBER\] cheeses\] and also create \[number \[NUMBER\]\] screen ✔

##### put together video ✔
structure for video

top \[NUMBER\] cheeses screen once
loop these until all images are cycled through (maybe even learn for loops and not just while loops)
number \[NUMBER\] screen
image of cheese
end of loop
thanks for watching screen

##### (stuff to use for video: https://github.com/h2non/videoshow https://www.npmjs.com/package/audioconcat) 

##### take user input for slide length in the video ✔

##### stitch together audio in audio folder to be used in video ✔
